# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Overview
By completing this final capstone project, you will apply various Data Analytics skills and techniques that you have learned as part of the previous courses in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. You will assume the role of an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organization and be presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets.

## Project Tasks
You will perform the various tasks that professional data analysts do as part of their jobs, including:
- **Data collection from multiple sources**
- **Data wrangling and data preparation**
- **Exploratory data analysis**
- **Statistical analysis and data mining**
- **Data visualization with different charts and plots**
- **Interactive dashboard creation**

## Final Deliverable
The project will culminate with a presentation of your data analysis report for various stakeholders in the organization. The report will include:
- An executive summary
- Your analysis
- A conclusion

You will be assessed on both your work for the various stages in the Data Analysis process, as well as the final deliverable.

## Tools and Technologies
Throughout this project, you will demonstrate your proficiency with:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **SQL**
- **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**
- **Business Intelligence (BI) tools like IBM Cognos Analytics**
- **Python Libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw data used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each stage of the data analysis process.
- `visualizations/`: Charts and plots created during the data visualization stage.
- `dashboard/`: Files related to the interactive dashboard.
- `report/`: Final data analysis report and presentation.

## How to Run
